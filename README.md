# Circular Sequencer

*Max 8.5*

This Max for Live Device creates MIDI-notes according to the circular motion of moving agents on a variable grid. 
Every tile on the grid represents a note which gets triggered when an agent reaches the tile.


The controls are: <br/>
**Grid**: number of tiles on each axis of the grid (maximum of 8)<br/>
**Motion Offset**: offset of the circular motion on the x and y axis<br/>
**Motion Rate**: the rotational speed in bars<br/>
**Agents**: number of moving agents (maximum of 16)<br/>
**Notes Pitch Offset**: the pitch of the first tile<br/>
**Notes Velocity**: velocity of the played notes<br/>
**Notes Length**: duration of the played notes<br/>

The interface looks like this:<br/>
